### Get in touch

Getting in touch is as easy as [creating a new issue](https://github.com/zadevchat/ping/issues/new).

We'll try to respond as soon as we can. Once we've answered, we'll close the issue just so we know what we've covered, but don't worry -- if you have any further questions just respond in the thread and we'll get back to you soon. Feel free to comment on older issues too, even if you didn't create it.

### Browse previous conversations

[Check out the closed issues filter](https://github.com/zadevchat/ping/issues?sort=created&direction√ûsc&state=closed&page=1) to browse previous conversations we've had. We try to use this as an email replacement everyone can see, so feel free to dig into some of the older threads.
